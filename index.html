             <p>Thank you for visiting and taking the time to explore the site. I invite you to click
                 around the links that you will find here to learn more about my design and
                 development background, skills, process, portfolio, and experience. Feel free to

            <div class="center"> <h3>My background</h3></div>
             <p>I am not a professional web designer or trained developer. However, I have extensive
                 experience in related fields and was awarded merit-based scholarship and worked as a
                 graduate assistant my time at university.</p>

             </figure>
             <p>I take inspiration from Beckett’s <cite>Trilogy</cite>:</p>
             <aside class="right"><q>There is nothing that does not distress the soul upon
                     reflection</q> (B. Pascal)

                 <figcaption>Pascal <cite>Pensées</cite></figcaption>
             </figure></aside>
             
             <blockquote>
                 <p>The fact would seem to be, if in my situation one may speak of facts, not only
                     that I shall have to speak of things of which I cannot speak, but also, which is
                     even more interesting, but also that I, which is if possible even more
                     interesting, that I shall have to, I forget, no matter. <br />(Samuel
                     Beckett)</p>
             </blockquote>
            
             
                 <p>If I were to point to one thing that really sets it apart from everyone else in the
                 world would be my ability to remember the things that are important and forget the
                 things really bug me.</p>
             
             <div class="center"><h3>My process</h3></div>
             <p>Over the years, I have developed a thorough process for the analysis, design, and
                 creation of material being posted on the web. In my process, I take the following
                 steps:</p>
                    <aside class="right"><q>If a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly</q> (G.K.
                 Chesterton)</aside>  
             <ol>
                 <li><p><b>Identify</b> – to ensure that both the needs and the expectations of the
                     client are met</p></li>
                 <li><p><b>Investigate</b> – in-depth research, exploration and examination of the
                     client’s needs</p></li>
                 <li><p><b>Integrate</b> – determining the project’s place within the overall marketing
                     strategy of the client</p></li>
                 <li><p><b>Illustrate</b> – draft and display and revise sample layouts and
                     interfaces</p></li>
             </ol>
